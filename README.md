# Anti-Tamper System

A lightweight anti-tamper solution designed to detect debugging, thread injection, and suspicious process manipulation.  
Built for Windows applications with low-level checks and minimal overhead.

---

## **Features**

- **Thread Monitoring**  
  Continuously enumerates threads within the process and detects unexpected creations or suspensions.

- **Debugger Detection**  
  Uses multiple techniques to detect attached debuggers, including:
  - `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent`
  - `NtQueryInformationProcess`
  - Hardware breakpoint scans
  - PEB-based debugger flags

- **Thread Context Verification**  
  Suspicious thread contexts are analyzed to detect hooks or breakpoints injected by external tools.

- **Pattern Scanning**  
  Verifies known code signatures in memory to detect tampering or unauthorized patches.

- **Self-Healing Mechanism** *(if implemented)*  
  Optionally restores altered bytes to maintain process integrity.

## **Usage**

1. **Integrate the DLL**  
   Inject or load the DLL into the target process at startup.

2. **Automatic Protection**  
   Once loaded, the anti-tamper system automatically:
   - Starts monitoring all active threads
   - Validates memory regions for known signatures
   - Detects and reports tampering in real time

3. **Logging** *(optional)*  
   You can enable console logging to debug or view anti-tamper triggers.

## **Techniques Used**

- PEB flag inspection
- Windows API checks for debugger presence
- Manual thread suspension and context checks
- Signature-based memory verification
- Detection of unexpected thread injection
